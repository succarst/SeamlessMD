I started analyzing the background from top top bottom (sky until fence) and then analyzed all animals and humans left to right (chicken to man). Finally analyzed the flowers left to right. When I was done I did a quick check to see if I missed anything by starting left to right on the whole screen. The initial process took 10 minutes and around 5 minutes to see if I missed anything for a total of under 15 minutes.
